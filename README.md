## Prerequisites

Before writing code for this breathe test, make sure you have to know following: 

- Turtle graphics and the usage of its methods.
- Mainly, setposition() which is to place a turtle in particular position by mentioning X and Y Coordinates, delay() method is used extend the time period of a turtle for moving one position to another position.
- Instead of setposition() we can use other methods for movement of turtle from one position to another position.
  
## Description

Initially, turtle moves from one position to another position at a default speed, parallely user needs to breathe in. Then after reaching to that position, turtle moves to another position with a time delay 100 milliseconds, now user has to hold the breathe until it reaches to its destination. Next it follows with breathe out. It just an alternative of Oximeter to check lungs functionality. User who ever completes this task then their lungs functionality is good.
